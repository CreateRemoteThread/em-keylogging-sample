# EM Keylogging Sample Data

This repository holds sample data for an electromagnetic keylogger. All code is available in the keyboards/ subdirectory of github/CreateRemoteThread/fuckshitfuck.

The toothpicks/ folder contains raw training data.
Trainset.npy contains the peak-extracted representation of the training data.
The floss- folders are "sample" signals to test against.

All this signal was captured in one go without moving the setup, so the noise floor should be relatively uniform.
